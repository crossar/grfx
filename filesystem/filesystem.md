files in this directory will be loaded into grfx
these files will be available at `/indexDB`

here is where file format for grfx files will be worked out
see `example.js`

for the time being, load `example.js` by default
then parse each `layer.def` to parity with current solution
also, dimension/zoom should be read from this file

as changes are made to config, save this to file

after this is complete, should be able to add an editor and see changes reflected in canvas
